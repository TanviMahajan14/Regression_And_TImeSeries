# 🛍️ Retail Sales Forecasting and Analysis  
**Master’s Capstone Project | Linear Regression & Time Series Modeling**

This project demonstrates a full-cycle data science approach to analyzing and forecasting retail sales. Using a real-world dataset (likely modeled after the Superstore dataset), I implemented data cleaning, regression analysis, and time series forecasting techniques to uncover business insights and predict future performance.

## 📊 Key Components  

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Parsed and standardized datetime columns (`Order Date`, `Ship Date`)
- Created features like shipping delay
- Removed outliers in sales and handled null values

### 🔹 Linear Regression Modeling
- Visualized feature relationships and correlations  
- Trained and tested a Linear Regression model  
- Evaluated performance using metrics like RMSE and R²

### 🔹 Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA)
- Decomposed sales into trend, seasonality, and residuals  
- Used Auto ARIMA for optimal (p, d, q) parameter selection  
- Forecasted future monthly sales with confidence intervals

## 📈 Visual Insights  
- Heatmaps for feature correlation  
- Regression line plots and residual analysis  
- ACF and PACF plots for ARIMA diagnostics  
- Trend decomposition and forecast visualizations

---

## ✅ Outcomes  
- Built interpretable models to guide retail strategy  
- Identified key sales drivers and temporal patterns  
- Delivered accurate sales forecasts to support decision-making
